### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As an enthusiastic and highly-skilled Sr Java and JavaScript/TypeScript/Angular/Webflow Engineer, I led the development of a complex financial management system for a large banking client. This system required integration with multiple APIs, complex data visualization, and secure user authentication. To accomplish this, I developed a modular architecture using Angular for the front-end and Java Spring for the back-end, which allowed for easy scalability and maintenance. Additionally, I implemented automated testing and deployment processes to ensure a smooth and error-free release.

Through my leadership and technical expertise, we were able to deliver this project on time and within budget, exceeding the client's expectations. The system has been praised for its intuitive user interface, speed, and reliability, and has helped our client streamline their financial processes and increase efficiency. This accomplishment not only showcased my technical skills but also my ability to collaborate with a team, manage a project, and deliver results that meet the needs of the client.
